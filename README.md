# NetworkSecurityFall23

This project was created to improve botnet detection by utilizing a hybrid Autoencoder-CNN architecture for the classification of benign and malicious network traffic data. The environment used in this work contains the dependencies of a Conda environment. The datasets used in this work can be found below.

N-BaIoT dataset:
MedBIoT Dataset:

Steps:
  1. Download datasets
  2. Run data_processing.ipynb to turn the raw data into pkl files
  3. Run NetSecProject.ipynb to create, train, and test the hybrid architecture as well as the baseline and SoTA architectures considered in this work.
